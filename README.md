# ZefoyBot-JAVA

# Don't skid this >:(

Doesn't require anything else but a browser and it's console
DOES NOT REQUIRE SELENIUM!
Note: Yes this is 100% real! I will make a youtube video on this code soon!
More features in the works:
Shares
Favorite
Followers(If they ever open that back up)
And more(Planning on automating every feature on zefoy)
At the moment, this is the only public method for zefoy views botting. This allows you to repeatly bot views on your video once you solve the captcha. Of course, the session will expire but you should at leasat have 20 - 30k views on your video!
You can use this in any browser that supports Java and a console


# Instructions:
Copy the Console.js Code
Go to Zefoy
Solve the Captcha
Remain on the home page
Open Inspect Element
Open the Console Tab
Disable Debugging and reload the page(or press the play button that should be visible)
Paste the code in the console and wait for it to load
Enter your Tiktok Video URL

Thats it!


# Future:
This might become a paid only script(Thinking about having people pay for the source)
